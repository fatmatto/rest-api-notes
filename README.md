# REST API notes
In this repository I will try to share all my experience about building rest apis. It's still a work in progress. Most of the code examples will be done in Javascript, since most of my work is done on NodeJS + ExpressJS, but every concept should be 100% compatible with any other programming language that can do HTTP(s) requests.


## Topics (still drafting)
* Hail to the king (Design with the API consumer in mind)
* Documentation is your Holy Bible
* Listen to the voices (Monitoring every thing that happens or doesn't happen)
* The importance of being an Error (400s are not just consumer's errors)
* Don't break the code of your api's consumers (break yours)
* Test output consistency as well as code, test documentation?
* Yes, you need Unit tests, Functional tests and E2E tests
* Flexibility will make your future self love your past self
* Deployments for highest availability and CI/CD for highest sanity
